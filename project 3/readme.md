Summary: 
As an analyst at Crankshaft List, the project goal is to study the dataset from the past few years, which consists of hundreds of free vehicle advertisements posted on the company's website daily. The objective is to determine the factors that influence the price of a vehicle.
To achieve this, several steps were taken, including handling missing values by filling certain columns with appropriate assumptions. In addition, inappropriate data types were corrected for better analysis.

The data analysis revealed interesting insights. Sedans and SUVs are the most numerous ads, with sedans being the most popular due to their relatively lower prices. Hatchbacks have the lowest prices, while buses have the fewest ads but appear to be the most expensive.
For sedans and SUVs, prices are highly influenced by the age of the vehicle and its mileage. New, excellent, like new, and good conditions command higher prices, while salvage and fair conditions are cheaper. Automatic transmission types are more correlated with higher prices.
In the case of SUVs, prices are significantly influenced by vehicle age and mileage, with transactions increasing significantly for vehicles aged 3 years or older and with mileage above 5000. The pricing of vehicles in "new" condition appears sporadic or unpredictable. Personal preferences seem to play a role in paint color choices and their correlation with prices.
