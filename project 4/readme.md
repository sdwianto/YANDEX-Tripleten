Summary: As an analyst for MEGALINE, a telecommunications operator, the company offers two prepaid packages, Surf and Ultimate. The advertising department aims to determine which package generates more revenue to adjust the advertising budget. The initial analysis is based on a sample of 500 clients, including data on identities, locations, package types, and call/message usage in 2018. The objective is to analyze client behavior and identify the package with higher revenue.
The Surf package costs $20/month with 500 minutes, 50 SMS, and 15 GB data. Additional charges apply for exceeding limits. The Ultimate package costs $70/month with 3000 minutes, 1000 SMS, and 30 GB data.
Conclusion: User behavior is similar for both packages, but the Surf package generates more revenue.

Findings:

-	Relationship between package and user age: Average age for Surf and Ultimate users is close. Surf is popular among young users, while Ultimate is preferred by older users.
-	Impact of user age on revenue: No significant pattern, revenue is evenly distributed across age groups.
-	Distribution of monthly phone calls, internet usage, and messages: Surf and Ultimate show similar averages with wider distribution for Surf due to more users.
