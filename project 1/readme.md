Summary:

Project Scope: The project aimed to compare user music preferences in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. The analysis focused on examining actual Y.Music data to test several hypotheses and compare user behavior in both cities.

Hypotheses:
User activities vary depending on the day and city.
On Monday mornings and Friday nights, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres.
Listeners in Springfield prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.

Results: 
The following three hypotheses were tested:
User activities vary depending on the day and city. This hypothesis was fully accepted as user activities were found to vary based on the day in both cities.
On Monday mornings and Friday nights, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. However, the data did not support this hypothesis as there were no significant genre differences during the week in either city. Both cities showed a preference for pop music.
Music preferences of users from Springfield and Shelbyville are highly similar. The third hypothesis was rejected, as the data indicated that the music preferences of users in both cities were not significantly different.
Overall, the analysis revealed that user activities in both cities vary depending on the day, but there were no significant genre differences between Springfield and Shelbyville. Additionally, the music preferences of users in both cities were found to be highly similar. It should be noted that the results may be affected by missing values in the data.
