-	The last five years' data was chosen as a benchmark for upcoming years, with PS4 having the most sales.
-	Action, Shooter, Role-Playing, and Sports were the most profitable game genres.
-	There were regional variations in popular platforms and genres, influenced by ESRB ratings.

Insights:
-	Platforms with potential for profit included PS4, PS3, X360, 3DS, and Xone.
-	Critic_score and total_sales showed a moderate positive correlation, while user_score and total_sales showed a weak negative correlation.
-	Games with Action, Shooter, Role-Playing, and Sports genres were recommended for development in upcoming years.
-	Campaign strategies should be tailored to each region's popular platforms and genres, considering ESRB ratings.

Recommendations for 2017 Campaign:
-	Focus on game platforms with potential for profit, such as PS4, PS3, X360, 3DS, and Xone.
