Summary:
Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago, aimed to find patterns in passenger preferences and understand the impact of external factors on the journey. The tasks involved studying databases, analyzing competitor data, and testing hypotheses related to the effect of weather on travel frequency.

Key Findings:
-	The Loop region had the highest average number of trips, with an average of 10,727.5 trips.
-	The top four regions for average trips (Loop, River North, Streeterville, and West Loop) showed significant differences compared to other regions, indicating they might have higher populations.
-	Flash Cab was the leading taxi company in the area.
-	Trips from Loop to O'Hare International Airport had different durations in good weather and bad weather conditions, particularly on Saturdays.
-	The variance and mean duration values of trips in good and bad weather were not significantly different.
-	During bad weather, drivers needed to add backup time to ensure passengers weren't late for their flight schedules.
-	There was a recommendation to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to anticipate and manage increasing trip durations during bad weather conditions.

Conclusion: 
The analysis of Zuber's ride-sharing database provided insights into the regions with the highest trip demand, identified the leading taxi company, and highlighted the impact of weather on trip durations. 


The findings recommended developing SOPs to handle trip delays during bad weather conditions, ensuring better service for passengers and improved operations for the ride-sharing company.
