#### <i> Sprint focus: Handling missing value and duplicate, change data type, data classification </i>

Summary: 
The project aims to prepare a report for the bank's credit department, investigating the impact of a customer's marital status and the number of children on the probability of loan repayment default. The report will be used in credit assessments to evaluate prospective borrowers' ability to repay their loans.

After data processing and handling missing values, it was assumed that the blank data was not mandatory and was left empty. The data between 'days_employees' and 'total_income' appeared to be symmetric. Using the median to replace missing values was found to be the most appropriate approach due to the insignificance and random distribution of missing data.

The conclusions drawn from the analysis suggest that the number of children does not significantly correlate with the risk of default. Customers with one or two children exhibit the highest payment compliance, and even among those with 20 children, only 8 experienced defaults. Overall, 91% of individuals with children make timely payments, while only 8% experience defaults. The risk of default for married individuals is 4.34%, and for individuals with medium income, the default rate is 4.7%.

Additionally, the potential default rate for housing loans is 3.65%, while the lowest potential default rate is for wedding loans at 0.86%. These findings can provide valuable insights for the bank's credit department in making informed decisions during credit assessments for potential customers.
